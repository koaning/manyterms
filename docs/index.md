The goal of this project is to collect lists of terms that might be used for: 

- weak labelling
- text classification
- entity detection
- term training for annotation
- fun

## High Quality? 

The goal of these wordlists is to be low-effort, but we cannot guarantee high quality. Maintaining high quality wordlists is hard work and outside of the scope of this project. If there is a serious issue with a word-list feel free to make a PR though. 

## Contributing 

You're free to add a list yourself, but we require that you always add a source with a permissive license.
